/*


History of Open
Remember getting books from the library with game source code for basic.


Definitions
Open Source
Open API - a service using open standards to make it's technology available to every developer in the world




Different characteristics of OSS and Open APIs:
Ethos, in particular with Free Software
Level of open


Characteristics of Open
Huge reach
Huge impact
Extremely low barrier to entry
Cost of distribution : creative business models required - fine line to walk




The huge impact of Open:
Open APIs and OSS are both about offering billions of dollars worth of technology to everyone on the planet who is capable of writing code.
Developers make the choice, not salesman selling to management. -> Survival of the fittest not best salesman.
Open feeds itself - The more you build, the more can be built.




Places Open Source is impacting:
It's hard to identify the complete impact.  Almost every product built today utilizes some OSS.
Nearly everything, including:
Data center technology
Financial industries
Office software
Government operations
Mobile
Publishing




Places Open APIs are impacting:
GIS
Payments
The business of relationships (social)
Media distribution (twitter)
Data Center technology (Amazon web services)


Future of OSS and Open APIs:
Improved tech leading the way -
OSS: 
DVCS
OSS feeding OSS
Technologies like OAuth, OpenID




Beyond OSS and OpenAPIs:
The ideas of Open are spreading beyond software
Open Knowledge (Wikipedia, Wikileaks) - disrupting traditional knowledge industry, governments etc
Open Communication - disrupting governments (twitter)
Creative Commons - opening content works, potential for disruption - I believe there's still more to come here
Open Publishing - huge potential
Open Music - future is still unclear
Open Government - making all government data open.  Tim OReilly big proponent.  Impact can be huge, like the Census Bureau's open map data.
